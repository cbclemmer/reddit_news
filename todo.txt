For reading papers:
collect a number of summaries together and make one larger summary from it.
It still has to keep in mind the summary immediately behind it when creating new summaries
To keep sentences from getting broken up, overlap the summerization chunks by 50 tokens or so
Maybe have a separate overall summerizer that constantly summarizes the last x summaries that fit into the context window?
Then funnel that to the researcher to use as the context for the new summary
