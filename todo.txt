// Use director notes in prompts for writers

Add support for github repo monitoring
Add support for discord monitoring

// Retry after open ai api call fails

// Support reading ARXIV archive pdfs from reddit posts

For reading papers:
// collect a number of summaries together and make one larger summary from it.
// It still has to keep in mind the summary immediately behind it when creating new summaries
// To keep sentences from getting broken up, overlap the summerization chunks by 50 tokens or so
// Maybe have a separate overall summerizer that constantly summarizes the last x summaries that fit into the context window?
// Then funnel that to the researcher to use as the context for the new summary

Split off the ARXIV reading functionality into it's own project:
    It should be run on a web server
    It should be able to print out the output periodically to the server
    Page should first ask for the id of the paper and an email address to send the completed request to
    Then it should display the name and abstract and ask for verification along with a question
    The webpage should periodically ping the server for updates and only the data that hasn't been sent yet should be sent to the webpage
    The ping should return whether the bot is done reading the paper and if it is done, fire the email and display that it is done on the page
